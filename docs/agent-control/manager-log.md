# Manager Log

Durable chronological log for scope, decisions, approvals, blockers, and
staging status. Do not rely on chat memory for acceptance or merge decisions.

Rotation rule: at each day rollover (or at ~150 lines), move the previous
day's entries to `archive/manager-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md` and refresh Current State.

## Current State (2026-08-03)

- Released npm baseline is `v2.4.2`. The annotated tag peels to corrected
  `origin/main` at `736becf34d929ea0bef88adbe476a584a1f081e9`,
  and Release Publish run `30523845440` completed successfully.
- WO-026 through WO-031 are accepted, merged, and released. The final
  integrated record is
  `docs/agent-control/wo-031-integrated-validation-baseline.md`.
- WO-031 preserved the frozen CLI, Enterprise, ingest, deterministic, package,
  upgrade, and memory contracts. Syntax, focused tests, context regressions,
  full root/MCP suites, five dependency audits, extracted-package smokes, and
  all six reviewer roles are green.
- Final memory medians are 631.46 MB for Cortex (+2.79% versus WO-026) and
  1,016.16 MB for Angular (-1.75%), inside the five-percent acceptance band.
- The accepted worktree `2.4.2` tarball contains 417 entries, all 19 CLI
  modules, all 15 canonical ingest modules, and all three ownership files. A
  clean-prefix install reports `2.4.2`. The clean release checkout correctly
  produces 416 entries because the intentionally unowned stale
  `scaffold/mcp/dist/embeddingModel.js` is absent.
- Release review fixed MCP registry Node-floor drift and added the registry
  submission to release-version synchronization and Release Bump staging. All
  six reviewers then closed with no blocker, major, or minor findings.
- Initial Release Publish run `30521392683` stopped safely before npm. PR #110
  fixed both release workflows to install/build `scaffold/mcp` before root
  tests and added ordering regressions. After reviewer acceptance and merge,
  the unpublished tag was deliberately moved from `bd968d4` to corrected
  `736becf`; run `30523845440` passed every gate and published npm `2.4.2`.
- R14 and R15 are mitigated locally. R16 remains the accepted pre-existing
  ingest filesystem-containment risk. Its behavior-changing remediation is now
  planned as WO-032 through WO-035 in context packet 022; the risk remains open
  until packed-artifact acceptance. WO-030's narrow same-user ancestor-swap
  assumption remains accepted.
- The modularization program and release recovery are complete. WO-032 and
  WO-033 are accepted locally. WO-033 established one canonical immutable
  real-project boundary for control/source/worker/README/dashboard-source
  reads; all review findings were fixed through `53a463c`. WO-034 is Ready
  from packet 024. R16 remains open through WO-035.

## Open Decisions

- Whether `cortex mcp` is deprecated for one release or removed directly in a
  future breaking release.
- Whether `@danielblomma/cortex-mcp` is retained as the npm package name during
  the CLI-first migration or followed by a new package with a migration
  window.
- Release classification/version for the R16 behavior change after WO-033 and
  WO-034 compatibility evidence is available.

## Closed Decisions

- The behavior-preserving CLI/ingest modularization program is accepted locally
  through WO-031.
- Patch release metadata may move to `2.4.2`; technical acceptance and six-role
  review completed before the bump.
- Under explicit user instruction, PRs #109 and #110 were merged, the failed
  unpublished tag was replaced with corrected `main`, and npm `2.4.2` was
  published only after the fixed release gates passed.
- R16 remediation is sequenced as WO-032 characterization/contract, WO-033
  source/control containment, WO-034 output containment/cleanup, and WO-035
  integrated package acceptance. External source roots are not authorized;
  portable relative roots only, with explicit symlink denial.
- WO-032's reviewed contract is accepted. Its safe-alias normalization is an
  intentional changed-mode correctness fix, repository identities use a
  separate host-valid grammar, and trusted parser toolchain/network behavior
  remains outside R16's ingest-managed data boundary.
- WO-033's reviewed source/control containment is accepted. Output,
  prior-cache, cleanup, and dashboard-data containment remain exclusively in
  WO-034; packed-artifact acceptance and R16 disposition remain in WO-035.

## 2026-08-03

- Created `plan/r16-ingest-filesystem-containment` from `main` at `6052686`.
- Used Cortex rules, search, and impact plus direct inspection of canonical
  ingest discovery, pipeline, I/O, and worker paths to scope R16.
- Added program packet 022, the detailed containment plan, WO-032 through
  WO-035, and REQ-16 traceability. The plan separates policy/characterization,
  source reads, output mutation, and packed-artifact acceptance so each work
  order can run in a fresh bounded session.
- R16 stays open. No runtime, release metadata, publish, tag, merge, or deploy
  action was taken.
- WO-032 characterized only synthetic temporary-root layouts. It confirmed
  current absolute/parent/explicit-symlink reads, symlinked control consumption,
  cache-parent redirection, direct symlink/hard-link truncation, and partial
  output replacement before a special-leaf failure.
- Added `wo-032-ingest-filesystem-containment-baseline.md` with the complete
  read/write inventory, frozen valid contracts, fail-closed ordering, bounded
  error ownership, migration rules, and honest concurrent-mutator residual.
  Added focused packet 023 for WO-033. Focused compatibility tests pass 19/19.
- WO-032's first review returned Contract and Security/Privacy majors. A
  documentation-only iteration addresses every finding without changing
  runtime behavior, tests, version, package, R16 status, or release state.
  Re-review remains required and WO-033 is still blocked.
- Parser query/WASM/.NET projects, DLLs, executables, optional publish/restore,
  and environment overrides are recorded as trusted package/operator
  toolchain artifacts, outside R16's ingest-managed data outputs. Existing
  dashboard `npm view` and optional .NET restore may use the network; the
  narrower requirement is no new source-data egress, telemetry, or network
  path.
- WO-034 now owns dashboard cache/embeddings manifests, relation JSONL, and
  npm-cache access, including denial before external read/mutation or npm
  invocation. WO-033 retains dashboard source scanning and must fail before
  `gatherData()` on unsafe controls/sources.
- Review-fix validation passed: C#/VB parser compatibility 25/25, context
  regressions 81/81, diff check, pattern evidence for 9/9 changed docs, Cortex
  update/graph completion with 0 failed, doctor 8/8, watcher stopped.
- Applied the two manager-specified pre-acceptance minor documentation
  corrections: the C#/VB target-framework overrides now use their exact
  `CORTEX_CSHARP_PARSER_TFM` and `CORTEX_VBNET_PARSER_TFM` names, and packet
  022 scopes the privacy statement to R16 source-data egress plus this
  program's no-new-telemetry or network-path requirement.
- Independent Contract and Security/Privacy re-reviews both returned PASS with
  no blocker or major finding. After the two minor corrections above, the
  manager accepted WO-032 and advanced WO-033 to Ready. R16 remains open.
- WO-033 implemented the canonical `filesystem-boundary.mjs`, immutable
  versioned real-root anchors, closed policy diagnostics and worker envelopes,
  contained control/source/Git/hydration/README/worker reads, and root/packaged
  dashboard source parity. The 25-case boundary matrix and frozen compatibility
  evidence passed; full root passed 348/348, context 81/81, MCP 413/413, and the
  `2.4.2` pack contained 418 entries.
- Initial review found parser, root rebinding, worker authority, dashboard
  lifecycle, diagnostic, and matrix gaps. `5ff7ece` fixed those findings. A
  final Security re-review found that arbitrary worker result objects could be
  downgraded to ordinary parse failures; `53a463c` now accepts only exact
  `{ chunks, errors }` array-valued results and adds the missing absolute ADR
  hydration case. Security and Contract re-reviews passed with no remaining
  finding; Code Quality/Integration had already passed.
- The manager accepted WO-033 locally and advanced WO-034 to Ready from packet
  024. Package/release metadata remains `2.4.2`; no merge, tag, publish, deploy,
  or R16 closure occurred.
